In this session we will use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs allow applications interact with other applications over a network.

Not only is this a look at using APIs but it is also a recap on using classes and functions.

To start, join the chat on Skinder - http://skinder.herokuapp.com/

Once you have done this, follow the steps in the `challenge` directory.

As always, speak up if you get stuck...
